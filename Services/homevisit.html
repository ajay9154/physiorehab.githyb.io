        <h2>What is home physiotherapy?</h2>
        <p>Home Physiotherapy Service offers the convenience of professional therapy in the comfort of your home. It is
          not always possible for a patient to visit the clinic due to illness or day-to-day activities.</p>

      </div>

        <h2>7 Benefits Of In-Home Physiotherapy</h2>
        <img src="../img/g-16.png" alt="Patient Photos">
        <p class="home-visit-para">Physiotherapy restores movement and function in the event of injury, such as a sports
          or work-related
          injuries, as well as illness and disability. It reduces pain, promotes recovery and reduces long-term damage
          that can result in the event of injury so that your quality of life is greatly improved. People of all ages
          can benefit from physiotherapy.

          However, many people do not realize that in-home physiotherapy is an option. In-home physiotherapy offers
          treatment in your own home as opposed to a traditional office or hospital based setting, the benefits of which
          will be considered below.</p>

        <div class="benifit-content">

          <h4>1. Progress Due to the Comforts of Home</h4>
          <p>The benefit of receiving treatment in the comfort of your own home cannot be understated. In your own
            home,
            you are in a familiar environment and therefore you are at your most comfortable and relaxed. The added
            comfort that is possible when receiving in-home physiotherapy can enhance treatment since you are in a
            much
            more relaxed state. It has also been shown that the elimination of distractions leads to more focused
            treatment. In some cases, progress may proceed faster.</p>

          <h4>2. Added Comfort</h4>
          <p>The added comfort was touched on above, but it is such a benefit of in-home physiotherapy that it
            deserves
            its own discussion. Many people do not enjoy clinical settings for a variety of different reasons and the
            ability to receive treatment in their own home suits them much more. The stressors of traveling, waiting
            time
            and other similar circumstances are entirely eliminated, making it possible for you to focus solely on
            your
            treatment.</p>

          <h4>3.Highly Personalized Care</h4>
          <p>Physiotherapy is also about education and giving you the tools to aid in your own recovery. When a
            physiotherapist visits your home, he or she is much more likely to make additional recommendations and
            modifications based on your current home, therein giving you access to even more opportunities to promote
            recovery than you would have otherwise received.

            In fact, in many instances, exercises may be tailored toward navigating your own home, therein giving you
            the
            practical skills you may need to live safely. Many people with mobility issues, for example, may have
            trouble
            getting around the home and in-home physiotherapy can be tailored toward improving those specific tasks.

            Moreover, physiotherapists who deliver in-home services tend to have fewer clients due to the fact that they
            have to schedule travel time. As such, they may be able to deliver longer treatment (upon your request).

          </p>

          <h4>4.Eliminates Obstacles</h4>
          <p>Although many people would benefit from physiotherapy, there are many different circumstances that can
            prevent them from being able to receive adequate treatment, or which would cause them to delay treatment
            because they are unable to travel to the clinic. These issues could be anything from transportation issues
            to
            mobility issues as a result of injury, disability or illness. In-home services, however, make it possible
            for
            people to access and benefit from physiotherapy, despite the obstacles that may stand in the way of
            receiving
            treatment.

          </p>


          <h4>5.Safer for High-Risk Individuals</h4>
          <p>There are many individuals who are considered high-risk patients and would put themselves in an unsafe
            environment by receiving in-office physiotherapy services. Perhaps they have an illness or disability that
            compromises their mobility. Perhaps they are an increased risk of infection in public places. At home
            physiotherapy, however, allows these high-risk individuals to greatly benefit from physiotherapy in the
            safety
            of their own home.

          </p>


          <h4>6.Highly Convenient & Time Saving</h4>
          <p>In-home physiotherapy services are highly convenient. In-home physiotherapy is offered at times that are
            flexible toward your own schedule. In fact, in many cases, in-home physiotherapists can also offer treatment
            at work or at another location that is convenient for you.

            It also eliminates all travel on your part, which allows you to save a lot of time in the process, as well
            as
            any waiting time that can occur when appointments run late or are delayed due to unforeseen circumstances.
            Many clients enjoy the ease at which in-home physiotherapy treatments fit into their life in a very seamless
            way.</p>

          <h4>7.Cost Savings</h4>
          <p>In-home physiotherapy results in additional savings due to the lack of travel, making it more economical
            compared to traditional, in-office physiotherapy services. Even if the travel time isn’t particularly
            lengthy,
            costs do add up over time.



          </p>
        </div>
        <p class="home-visit-para">As you can see above, there are many reasons why in-home physiotherapy is very
          beneficial. From the added comfort and convenience of receiving treatment in your own home to the ability to
          eliminate obstacles present in traditional physiotherapy settings, there are many reasons why in-home
          physiotherapy may be a good fit for you.</p>
